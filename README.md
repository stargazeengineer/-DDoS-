# Performance Analysis of DDoS Attack Detection Based on Machine Learning Algorithms

In recent years, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have become a major challenge in the field of network security. This study aims to analyze different machine learning algorithms and identify the best one to improve the accuracy of DDoS attack detection. I selected five classic machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, and conducted experiments on the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset.

The results showed that Random Forest, SVM, and KNN performed excellently, achieving accuracy and F1-scores above 99.74%. Logistic Regression had an accuracy of 97.82%, but still exhibited a small number of classification errors. Naive Bayes performed relatively poorly when processing network traffic data due to its assumption of independent features. I also used ROC curves and AUC values to evaluate the performance of the models.

This study analyzed the applicability and advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning algorithms in DDoS attack detection, providing a reference for practical applications. The project code includes the complete process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, making it convenient for researchers to reproduce the experimental results.The code is also in this file and includes explanations for each step.
